        \nAcknowledgements\n
        Part of the layout of the symbol keyboard in Maxima Keyboard is a modified copy of
        Std Math Keyboard, created by Leonel Hern√°ndez. The original Std Math Keyboard can
        be obtained from Google Play.\n\n
        With my request, Leonel san has kindly allowed me to use the layout with any
        modifications.\n\n
        The layout is extremely superior as the symbol keyboard not only have frequently used
        symbols, but also frequently used alphabets in math, such as x,y,z, and a,b,c.
        This makes the switching between querty and symbol keyboad significantly less.\n\n
        My modification is to add few Maxima symbols in this layout.\n\n
        I express my great thanks to Leonel san.\n\n
        Most of this software is based on the sample source code\n\n
        https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/SoftKeyboard/src/com/example/android/softkeyboard\n\n
        which is licensed under Apache 2.0 license.\n\n
        I express thanks to the authors of this sample source code.
