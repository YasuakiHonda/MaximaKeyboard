# MaximaKeyboard

Software Keyboard designed for Maxima on Android.

There are three distinct input panes:
- Qwerty keyboard
- Frequently used symbols, x,y,z, a,b,c, numbers
- All symbols and numbers

## Original code
All the java codes and resources in this project are derived from Sample Keyboard source code in the Android Opensource Project [samples/Softkeyboard](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/SoftKeyboard/). I would like to thank AOP.

## Original layout of the keyboard
The pane of frequently used symbols, x,y,z, a,b,c, and numbers is based on Standard Math Keyboard.apk available from Google play. I contacted Leonel Hernandez, the developer of the Standard Math Keyboard.apk. He has kindly allowed me to use this layout for derived works. I have slightly modified to more Maxima friendly, but the original idea of this combination of characters in a same pane is definitely the invention of Leonel Hernandez. I would like to thank him.
